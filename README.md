# README

This project is my submission for WEBD 5201 WEB DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORKS Assignment 4.
I was required to follow allong with the CRUD application tutorial from https://github.com/spkdroid/CRUD-RubyOnRails and enhance it.
For some reason the destroy method never worked, I spent between 3-4 hours trying to troubleshoot the destroy method specifically but found no success.

**MY ENHANCEMENTS**
I enhanced the application by greatly improving the UI, and adding additional search functionality.
Some of the UI features I added were:
  -Navbar at the top of every page
  -Additional links on the navbar to return to task list, make a new task, or search through tasks
  -Created a table to store the tasks in the center of the page
  -Updated visuals to be more modernized
  -Added alert boxes when tasks are created, updated, and _deleted_
  -Search bar to search database for specific tasks

Using the search bar at the top of each page, you can type in the name of a task and it will bring up all results.


**RUNNING THE APPLICATION**
To run the application, type "rails server" into the cmd while in the project directory, and it will give you a local host link where the webpage will be accessible.
